            <p>AirCharts was originally started in 2011 as an alternative to VATSIM's Chart Finder which relied on human interaction when new AIRACs were published.  AirCharts was designed to handle
            AIRAC changes automatically for seemless changes between AIRAC periods and get the most up-to-date information to virtual pilots worldwide.</p>
            <p>As time went on, AirCharts was expanded beyond coverage of just the US.  We're adding charts for areas where they are publicly available.</p>
            <p>AirCharts was originally developed by Daniel Hawton and Rahul Parkar, and is currently run and maintained by Daniel Hawton.</p>
